# 🪨📄✂️ Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## 🎮 About the Project

This is a **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game I built using **vanilla JavaScript** and **Tailwind CSS** as a weekend project! My goal was to reinforce fundamental JavaScript concepts like **event handling, UI responsiveness, and local storage**, while keeping things lightweight and fun.

👉 **Try it out here:** [taylorpitman.com/rock-paper-scissors-js](https://taylorpitman.com/rock-paper-scissors-js/)

One of the main reasons I built this project was to ensure that I truly understand **what happens behind the scenes** before applying these concepts in **React**. While frameworks make development faster, I want to make sure I have a solid foundation in JavaScript so I can write more efficient and maintainable code in larger projects.

## ✨ Features & What I Learned

✅ **Modular JavaScript** – The game logic is structured with functions that handle the mechanics of score tracking, winner determination, and animations.  

✅ **Local Storage for Score Tracking** – Wins, losses, and ties persist even after a page refresh using `localStorage`.  

✅ **Tailwind CSS for Rapid Styling** – No need for a separate CSS file! The UI is built using Tailwind utility classes, making styling clean and efficient.  

✅ **Interactive UI with FontAwesome Icons** – Instead of plain text, the game displays **animated icons** for player and computer choices, improving the user experience.

## 🔥 Challenges & Future Enhancements  

💡 **Enhancing Animations** – Right now, the UI has `hover:animate-bounce` effects, but I’d love to add smoother **transitions and sound effects** for a more dynamic feel.  

💡 **Smarter AI** – The computer picks moves at random, but I could implement an **adaptive AI** that learns player tendencies.  

💡 **Multiplayer Mode?** – A local **PvP** version or even an online mode where users can play against each other would be a fun extension!

## 🛠️ Getting Started  

If you’d like to run this project locally, follow these steps:

### **Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/taylorpitman/rock-paper-scissors-js.git


## 📂 Open the Project  
Since this is a simple front-end project, you can just open `index.html` in your browser.

## 🚀 Why Small Projects Matter  
Even a simple game like this reinforces essential **JavaScript and UI design** principles. Before diving deep into frameworks like **React**, I want to ensure I have a strong grasp of **state management, DOM manipulation, and user interactions**.  

If you're learning **front-end development**, I highly recommend building small projects like this—you’ll improve your **problem-solving skills** and have fun while coding!
